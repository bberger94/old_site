I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy at Harvard University and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. I study how public policy shapes the diffusion of scientific breakthroughs and adoption of innovative health care technologies. 

Prior to attending Harvard, I worked as a research assistant at the National Bureau of        Economic Research. I graduated _magna cum laude_ from the University of Miami in 2016 with a Bachelor's in Economics and Mathematics.
